#================================================================
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
#=================================================================

#pseudo-code idea
# two for loops nested for product A*B
# one loop to iterate across all 3 digit A for a given B
# one loop to increment B
# as we do this, check if palindrome and add to a list
# at the end find the max of the list

# other thoughts about idea:
# keep in mind commutative property (2*8 = 8*2), so that means I can cut computation in half if I consider this symmetry
# By what fraction does it reduce computation, my intuition is 1/2, maybe not worth the extra effort?
# perhaps I'll come back to a faster algorithm as a stretch goal
